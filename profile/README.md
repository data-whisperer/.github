# Job Search & Matching System  

This project is a **Job Search Platform** that fetches jobs from multiple job boards and intelligently matches them with user profiles using AI/ML models.  

The goal is to **deliver highly relevant job recommendations** based on user preferences, resumes, and keyword-driven searches.

## üöÄ Functional Requirements  

### 1. User Management System  
- User Registration & Authentication  
- Profile creation & management  
- Job preferences (location, role, type, experience)  
- Resume upload & analysis (extract skills, roles, keywords)  

### 2. Resume Analysis System  
- Extract skills & keywords from uploaded resumes  
- Store structured data in user profiles  

### 3. Keyword Generator (Worker)  
- Uses ML/LLM models to generate relevant keywords from user profiles and preferences  
- Stores generated keywords in queue for job fetching  

### 4. Cron Job (Scheduler)  
- Triggers keyword-based searches every day  
- Initiates job fetching pipeline  

### 5. Job Fetch System (Worker)  
- Fetches jobs from multiple job boards using APIs/scrapers  
- Stores job descriptions in cache & database  
- Ensures deduplication using idempotency keys  

### 6. Job Processor System (Worker)  
- Talks to AI/LLM model to score relevance of a job against a user profile  
- Produces a ‚Äúmatch score‚Äù  

### 7. Job Management System  
- Stores job postings in DB  
- Handles job deduplication, updates & queries  
- Provides APIs for frontend

## ‚öôÔ∏è Non-Functional Requirements  

### 1. Consistency vs Availability  
- A job posting can afford **eventual consistency**.  
- Availability is prioritized over strict consistency.  

### 2. Idempotency  
- Every job fetched is assigned a **unique idempotency key**.  
- Prevents duplicate processing, reducing AI/LLM computation costs.  

### 3. Scalability & Throughput  
- Designed with workers, queues, and caches for horizontal scaling.  
- Load balancers manage worker nodes.

## üîÑ Workflow  

1. User registers & sets job preferences  
2. Resume uploaded ‚Üí analyzed ‚Üí keywords generated  
3. Cron job triggers job fetching daily  
4. Job Fetch Worker pulls jobs from job boards  
5. Jobs stored in DB + Cache (with idempotency check)  
6. Job Processor Worker calls AI/LLM to score job relevance  
7. Jobs ranked & served to frontend for user

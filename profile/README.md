# üöÄ JobMatch Platform

Welcome to the **JobMatch Organization**!  
Our mission is to simplify job hunting by **aggregating job descriptions from multiple platforms** (LinkedIn, Indeed, StepStone, etc.) and **intelligently matching them to a user's profile**.  

This organization consists of multiple repositories, each handling a dedicated part of the system ‚Äî from job fetching to profile matching to frontend presentation.
